# The ZAO (ZTalent Artist Organization) Ecosystem

## Core Mission and Vision

The ZAO is a community-driven hub where musicians, artists, and technologists unite to unlock the potential of Web3 and emerging technologies. The organization's mission is to empower independent creators by demystifying technology and providing the tools, knowledge, and support they need to take control of their work, data, and fan connections.

In a world where traditional labels and platforms take large percentages of revenue, the ZAO offers a decentralized, peer-to-peer system that puts profits and power back into the hands of creators. The ZAO believes in breaking down technological and financial jargon so anyone with an internet connection can join the creator economy.
