## The Respect Game

The Respect Game is The ZAO's core engagement mechanism, where:

1. Members share their weekly contributions to the community
2. The community votes on which contributions provided the most value
3. $ZAO tokens are distributed based on community consensus
4. Special recognition is given to exceptional contributions
5. The process reinforces community values and desired behaviors

The Respect Game typically occurs during Hivemind meetings and serves as both a governance mechanism and a community building activity.
